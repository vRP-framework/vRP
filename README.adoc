NOTE: This is vRP 2, the second major version of vRP. It aims to have less overhead and a more straightforward and structured approach using OOP. This will probably be the last major version, vRP based resources can be updated for vRP 2 using the extension system. See the link:doc/dev/README.adoc[developers documentation].
