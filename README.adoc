_FiveM RP addon/framework_ +
The project aim to create a generic and simple RP framework to prevent everyone from reinventing the wheel. +
Contributions are welcomed.

TIP: Config examples are git branches as `cfg_NAME...`. It's easier to update, for example if `cfg_FR` is not up-to-date, you could do a `git merge` from the last version.

== NOTES
=== Homes

WARNING: The home system is experimental, don't expect too much from it at this point. But it's a good basis for some RP interactions, and further developments.

==== How it works

Homes are closed interiors allocated to players when they want to go inside their home, it means that if no slots are availables, you can't enter to your home. Slots are freed when everyone moves out, die, crash or disconnect inside, the slot could not close itself in rare cases, only "eject all" will close the slot. So it's possible that all slots are locked after a while, restarting the server will fix the issue.

Also, player addresses are bound to the home cluster name, it means that if you change the cluster configuration name, players will not be able to enter/sell their home anymore. So choose the name well and don't change it, if you don't want to deal with this.

TIP: Home components allow developers to create things to be added inside homes using the config files. See the home API.

== Tutorials

=== Deployment
==== Installation

NOTE: vRP has been tested under Windows and GNU/Linux with Mono 4.8.

Clone the repository or download the master https://github.com/ImagicTheCat/vRP/archive/master.zip[archive] and copy the `vrp` and `vrp_mysql` directories to your resource folder. Add `vrp_mysql` then `vrp` to the loading resource list (first after the basic FiveM resources is better).

==== Configuration

WARNING: Only the files in the `cfg/` directory should be modified. Modifying the vRP core files is highly discouraged (don't open an issue if it's about modified core files).

There is only one required file to configure before launching the server, `cfg/base.lua`, to setup the MySQL database credentials.

There is a lot to configure in vRP, nothing comes preconfigured so everyone can make his unique server. +
Everything you need to know is in the configuration files, but if you have troubles configuring, look at the configuration of the vRP LaTest servers above.

==== Update

.A good way to update (bleeding-edge):
. use git to clone vRP to create your own version of it, checkout the branch you want, create a branch from it
. create a symbolic link (or an update script) to `vrp/` in your fxserver resources directory
. (repeat) configure, commit your changes, stay updated with the vRP repository, solve conflicts

This way, you will know when config files should be updated and what exactly has been updated.

.A more primitive way to update:
. save your `cfg/` folder somewhere
. copy all new files in `vrp/`
. compare your old `cfg/` folder with the new one, fill the gaps (one mistake will break everything, take your time)
. replace the new `cfg/` folder with the old modified `cfg/` folder

==== Issues / Features / Help

WARNING: The issue section is only for bug reports and feature requests. I will close (and ban) issues not related to the core of vRP, to keep the github clean.
Don't submit issues about your own modifications, I will close them without warning.

When submitting an issue, add any information you can find, with all details. Saying that something doesn't work is useless and will not solve the issue.
If you have errors in your console BEFORE the issue happen, everything could be corrupted, so the issue is irrelevant, you should solve all unrelated errors before submitting issues.

NOTE: For questions, help, discussions around the project, please go instead on the vRP thread of the FiveM forum here: https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-vrp-framework/22894

=== Events
==== Base

[source,lua]
----
-- (server) called after identification
AddEventHandler("vRP:playerJoin",function(user_id,source,name,last_login) end)

-- (server) called when the player join again without triggering the vRP:playerLeave event before
-- (used after a client crash for example)
AddEventHandler("vRP:playerRejoin",function(user_id,source,name) end)

-- (server) called when a logged player spawn
AddEventHandler("vRP:playerSpawn", function(user_id, source, first_spawn) end)

-- (server) called when a player leave
AddEventHandler("vRP:playerLeave",function(user_id, source) end)

-- (server) called when a player join a group
-- gtype can be nil
AddEventHandler("vRP:playerJoinGroup", function(user_id, group, gtype) end)

-- (server) called when a player leave a group
-- gtype can be nil
AddEventHandler("vRP:playerLeaveGroup", function(user_id, group, gtype) end)

=== API

To call the server-side API functions, get the vRP interface.

[source,lua]
----
local Proxy = module("vrp", "lib/Proxy")

vRP = Proxy.getInterface("vRP")

-- ex:
local user_id = vRP.getUserId(source)
----

You can also do it client-side, the API is the same as the TUNNEL CLIENT APIs.

[source,lua]
----
vRP = Proxy.getInterface("vRP")

-- ex:
vRP.notify("A notification.") -- notify the player
----

For the client/server tunnel API, the interface is also `vRP`, see the Tunnel library below.

TIP: In the config file callbacks, you can use directly the globals `vRP` (Proxy) and `vRPclient` (the tunnel to the clients).

==== Group/permission

Group and permissions are a way to limit features to specific players.
Each group have a set of permissions defined in `cfg/groups.lua`.
Permissions can be used with most of the vRP modules, giving the ability to create specific garages, item transformers, etc.

===== Regular permissions

Regular permissions are plain text permissions, they can be added to groups. You can add a `-` before the permission to negate (even if other groups add the permission, they will be ignored).

===== Special item permission

You can use a special permission to check for items.
Form: `#idname.operator`, operators to check the amount are greater `>`, less `<`, equal ` `.

====
* `#tacos.>0` -> one or more tacos
* `#weed.1` -> exactly one weed
====

===== Special aptitude permission

You can use a special permission to check for aptitudes. +
Form: `@group.aptitude.operator`, operators to check the level are greater `>`, less `<`, equal ` `. 

====
* `@physical.strength.3` -> strength level equal to 3
* `@science.chemicals.>4` -> chemicals science level greater or equal to 5
====

===== Special function permission

Permissions can also be custom functions, registered by `vRP.registerPermissionFunction`. +
Form: `!name.param1.param2...`

.Here is a list of permission functions defined by vRP:
[horizontal]
!not. ...:: negation of another permission function (ex `!not.is.inside`)
!is.inside:: check if the player is inside a building (approximation)
!is.invehicle:: check if the player is inside a vehicle

===== API

vRP.getUserGroupByType(user_id,gtype)

-- return list of connected users by group
vRP.getUsersByGroup(group)

-- return list of connected users by permission
vRP.getUsersByPermission(perm)
----

==== Survival

Running, walking, being hurt/injured, and just living add hunger and thirst. When the hunger and the thirst are at their maximum level (100%), next hunger/thirst overflow will damage the character by the same amount (ex: when thirsty, don't run, take a car).

NOTE: This module disable the basic health regen.

The survival module implement also a coma system. If the health of the player is below the coma threshold, the player is in coma for a specific duration before dying. The health (thus coma) is recorded in the player state.
If a player disconnect and reconnect while in coma, he will fall in coma again and die in a few seconds.

----

==== Money

The money is managed with direct SQL queries to prevent most potential value corruptions.
The wallet empties itself when respawning (after death).

-- TUNNEL CLIENT API
----

==== Inventory

The inventory is autosaved and, as the wallet, gets empty upon death.

===== Items

Items are simple identifiers associated with a quantity in an inventory. But they can also be parametrics.

Parametrics items are identified like other items in the inventory but also have arguments as: `weapon|pistol` instead of just an ID. Parametric items don't contain any data, they are generic item definitions that will be specialized by the arguments.

[source,lua]
----
-- PROXY API

-- idname: unique item name
-- name: display name or genfunction
-- description: item description (html) or genfunction
-- choices: menudata choices (see gui api) only as genfunction or nil
-- weight: weight or genfunction
--
-- genfunction are functions returning a correct value as: function(args) return value end

.Full example of a resource defining a water bottle item.
====
Once defined, items can be used by any resources (ex: they can be added to shops).

[source,lua]
----
local Proxy = module("vrp", "lib/Proxy")
local Tunnel = require("vrp", "lib/Tunnel")

vRP = Proxy.getInterface("vRP")
vRPclient = Tunnel.getInterface("vRP","vrp_waterbottle")

-- create Water bottle item 
local wb_choices = {}  -- (see gui API for menudata choices structure)

wb_choices["Drink"] = {function(player,choice) -- add drink action
  local user_id = vRP.getUserId(player) -- get user_id
  if user_id then
    if vRP.tryGetInventoryItem(user_id,"water_bottle",1) then -- try to remove one bottle
      vRP.varyThirst(user_id,-35) -- decrease thirst
      vRPclient.notify(player,"~b~ Drinking.") -- notify
      vRP.closeMenu(player) -- the water bottle is consumed by the action, close the menu
    end
end
end,"Do it."}

-- add item definition
vRP.defInventoryItem("water_bottle","Water bottle","Drink this my friend.",function() return wb_choices end,0.5)

-- (at any time later) give 2 water bottles to a connected user
vRP.giveInventoryItem(user_id,"water_bottle",2)
----

==== Item transformer

The item transformer is a very generic way to create harvest and processing areas.

.The concept:
* you can use the action of the item transformer when entering the area
* the item transformer has a number of work units, regenerated at a specific rate
* the item transformer takes reagents (money, items or none) to produce products (money or items) and it consumes a work unit

This way, processing and harvesting are limited by the work units.

TIP: Item transformers can be dynamically set and removed, if you want to build random harvest points.

[source,lua]

===== Extending menus

Some menus can be built/extended by any resources with menu builders.

.List of known menu names you can extend, each line is `description (data properties)`:
[horizontal]
main:: main menu (player)
police:: police menu (player)
admin:: admin menu (player)
vehicle:: vehicle menu (user_id, player, vname)
phone:: phone menu, no properties, builders are called one time after server launch
static:<name>:: any static menu, replace `<name>` by the static menu name (player)

[source,lua]
----
-- PROXY API

-- register a menu builder function
--- name: menu type name
--- builder(add_choices, data) (callback, with custom data table)
---- add_choices(choices) (callback to call once to add the built choices to the menu)
vRP.registerMenuBuilder(name, builder)

-- build a menu
--- name: menu name type
--- data: custom data table

==== Audio

[source,lua]
----
-- TUNNEL CLIENT API

-- play audio source (once)
--- url: valid audio HTML url (ex: .ogg/.wav/direct ogg-stream url)
--- volume: 0-1 
--- x,y,z: position (omit for unspatialized)
--- max_dist  (omit for unspatialized)
vRP.playAudioSource(url, volume, x, y, z, max_dist)

-- set named audio source (looping)
--- name: source name
--- url: valid audio HTML url (ex: .ogg/.wav/direct ogg-stream url)
--- volume: 0-1 
--- x,y,z: position (omit for unspatialized)
--- max_dist  (omit for unspatialized)
vRP.setAudioSource(name, url, volume, x, y, z, max_dist)

-- remove named audio source
vRP.removeAudioSource(name)
----
===== Notes

* it uses the Web Audio API of CEF
* CEF used by FiveM doesn't have mp3/m3u support, so only direct links to ogg/vorbis/(maybe opus) stream will work (for radio stream)
* .wav/.ogg formats are supported
* there is no optimization for punctual audio sources, they will be added and removed when they end (no cache)
* punctual audio sources will not play if the player is `2*max_dist` far away
* persistent audio sources will pause themselves when the player is `2*max_dist` far away, and play again when inside this radius (save the bandwidth for radio streams or big music files)

==== VoIP

The VoIP system of vRP is designed using WebRTC and a p2p architecture. It allows to create things like voice chat with spatialization, group radio with audio effects (ex: police radio) or phone calls. It is an experimental feature.

NOTE: Check `cfg/client.lua` and `cfg/gui.lua` to configure the VoIP (to also replace the internal voice chat if wanted).
You will need to setup a STUN/TURN server to have WebRTC working properly.

TIP: You can use https://github.com/coturn/coturn[coturn] which should be available on most platforms/distributions and is a STUN and TURN server.

.Basic example
====
* launch turnserver: `turnserver -a -u user:password -r "myserver"`
* configure iceServers
* {blank}

=== Libs

==== utils

`lib/utils` defines global tools required by vRP and vRP extensions.

[source,lua]
----
-- load a lua resource file as module
-- rsc: resource name
-- path: lua file path without extension
module(rsc, path)

-- create an async returner (require a Citizen thread) (also alias for Citizen.CreateThreadNow)
-- return returner (r:wait(), r(...))
async()

-- CLIENT and SERVER globals
-- booleans to known the side of the script
----

WARNING: Any function making usage of `async()` require a Citizen thread if not already in one. Citizen will throw an error if you're not in one.

==== Proxy

The proxy lib is used to call other resources functions through a proxy event.

====
.resource1.lua
[source,lua]
----
local Proxy = module("vrp", "lib/Proxy")

Resource1 = {}
Proxy.addInterface("resource1",Resource1) -- add functions to resource1 interface (can be called multiple times if multiple files declare different functions for the same interface)

function Resource1.test(a,b)
  print("resource1 TEST "..a..","..b)
  return a+b,a*b -- return two values
end
----

.resource2.lua
[source,lua]
----
local Proxy = module("vrp", "lib/Proxy")

Resource1 = Proxy.getInterface("resource1")

local rvalue1, rvalue2 = Resource1.test(13,42)
print("resource2 TEST rvalues = "..rvalue1..","..rvalue2)
----
====

The notation is `Interface.function(...)`.

TIP: Good practice is to get the interface once and set it as a global, but if you want to get multiple times the same interface from the same resource, you need to specify a unique identifier (the name of the resource + a unique id for each one). 

==== Tunnel

The idea behind tunnels is to easily access any declared server function from any client resource, and to access any declared client function from any server resource.

.Example of two-way resource communication
====
.Server-side myrsc:
[source,lua]
----
local Tunnel = module("vrp", "lib/Tunnel")

-- build the server-side interface
serverdef = {} -- you can add function to serverdef later in other server scripts
Tunnel.bindInterface("myrsc",serverdef)

function serverdef.test(msg)
  print("msg "..msg.." received from "..source)
  return 42
end

-- get the client-side access
clientaccess = Tunnel.getInterface("myrsc") 

-- (later, in a player spawn event) teleport the player to 0,0,0
clientaccess.teleport(source,0,0,0)
----

.Client-side myrsc: 
[source,lua]
----

-- build the client-side interface
clientdef = {} -- you can add function to clientdef later in other client scripts
Tunnel.bindInterface("myrsc",clientdef)

function clientdef.teleport(x,y,z)
  SetEntityCoords(GetPlayerPed(-1), x, y, z, 1,0,0,0)
end

-- sometimes, you would want to return the tunnel call with asynchronous data
-- ex:
function clientdef.setModel(hash)
  local r = async()

  Citizen.CreateThread(function()
    -- do the asynchronous model loading
    Citizen.Wait(1000)

    r(true)  -- return true 
  end)

  return r:wait() -- wait for the async returned value
end

-- get the server-side access
serveraccess = Tunnel.getInterface("myrsc")

-- call test on server and print the returned value (in an async context)
local r = serveraccess.test("my client message")
print(r) -- true
----

Now if we want to use the same teleport function in another resource:

[source,lua]
----
local Tunnel = module("lib/Tunnel")

-- get the client-side access of myrsc
myrsc_access = Tunnel.getInterface("myrsc","myotherrsc")

-- (later, in a player spawn event) teleport the player to 0,0,0
myrsc_access.teleport(source,0,0,0)
----
====

This way resources can easily use other resources client/server API.

The notation is `Interface.function(dest, ...)`.

TIP: Good practice is to get the interface once and set it as a global, but if you want to get multiple times the same interface from the same resource, you need to specify a unique identifier (the name of the resource + a unique id for each one). 

NOTE: Tunnel and Proxy are blocking calls in the current coroutine until the values are returned, to bypass this behaviour, especially for the Tunnel to optimize speed (ping latency of each call), use `_` as prefix for the function name (Proxy/Tunnel interfaces should not have functions starting with `_`). This will discard the returned values, but if you still need them, you can make normal calls in a new Citizen thread with `Citizen.CreateThreadNow` or `async` to have non-blocking code.

WARNING: Also remember that Citizen event handlers (used by Proxy and Tunnel) seem to not work while loading the resource, to use the Proxy at loading time, you will need to delay it with `Citizen.CreateThread` or a `SetTimeout`.

==== Database

SQL queries are managed by DB drivers, you can use the default vRP driver `vrp_mysql` or use a custom one (`vrp_mysql` has crappy code, see https://github.com/ImagicTheCat/vRP-db-drivers[alternatives]).

DB drivers will register themselves (as resources) with a specific name to use in `cfg/base.lua`. Since there is no guarantee about when the driver will be registered, all queries will be cached until that moment. 

NOTE: `[vRP] DB driver "driver_name" not initialized yet (X prepares cached, Y queries cached).`  is not an error, but a warning that the driver is not registered yet and will stop being outputted if the driver is loaded (a message will also say that the driver is loaded).

[source,lua]
----
-- API (PROXY)

-- register a DB driver
--- name: unique name for the driver
--- on_init(cfg): called when the driver is initialized (connection), should return true on success
---- cfg: db config
--- on_prepare(name, query): should prepare the query (@param notation)
--- on_query(name, params, mode): should execute the prepared query
---- params: map of parameters
---- mode: 
----- "query": should return rows (list of map of parameter => value), affected
----- "execute": should return affected
----- "scalar": should return a scalar
vRP.registerDBDriver(name, on_init, on_prepare, on_query)

-- prepare a query
--- name: unique name for the query
--- query: SQL string with @params notation
vRP.prepare(name, query)

-- execute a query
--- name: unique name of the query
--- params: map of parameters
--- mode: default is "query"
---- "query": should return rows (list of map of field => value), affected
---- "execute": should return affected
---- "scalar": should return a scalar
vRP.query(name, params, mode)

-- shortcut for vRP.query with "execute"
vRP.execute(name, params)

-- shortcut for vRP.query with "scalar"
vRP.scalar(name, params)
----

.Usage
====
[source,lua]
----
-- execute the command after a while, get all banned users
local rows, affected = vRP.query("vRP/myrsc_getbans", {banned = true}) -- in async context
-- rows: rows as a list
-- affected: number of rows affected (when updating things, etc)
-- display banned users

-- execute the command after a while, get all non banned users
local rows, affected = vRP.query("vRP/myrsc_getbans", {banned = false}) -- in async context
-- rows: rows as a list
-- affected: number of rows affected (when updating things, etc)
-- display banned users
